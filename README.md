## Description:
* Main goal of the app is to get every information available of a Restaurant by using different APIs (like: Google, Yelp, Foursquare, etc).

* By this time, the app uses User's geolocation to list nearby places from Yelp API. And, after that, it gets more info about each place from Google Places.

* Then, User is able to select a restaurant and check pictures and reviews from both Google Places and Yelp.
